            <p>I am not poor! Why should I help in eliminating poverty? Well, we are all humans and are dependent on
               each other for our needs. Initially, if you see a poor farmer you might get a notion that you are not
               dependent on him because he seems poor and struggling to have a good living. But wait, where does food on
               your plate come from? You got your answer, right! Likewise, we are dependent on daily wage laborers,
               rickshaw pullers, etc. and so are they on us. So eliminating poverty will make the life of the poor ones
               better which will indirectly reflect in our lives too.</p>

               <p><strong>Waterloo, Iowa</strong></p>
               <p>As Roberta pulled up to the holiday food distribution at Northeast Iowa Food Bank the Monday before
                  Thanksgiving, her 9-year-old son Elijah was sitting in the back seat, a computer on his lap, doing
                  schoolwork. Meanwhile, her daughter, the bubbly, rambunctious 4-year-old Eliona, just wanted to charm
                  the volunteers.</p>
               <p>“She loves being the center of attention,” Roberta laughed as Eliona popped out of the car, giggling
                  and jumping around. Roberta has a career in home healthcare but needed a little extra help this year
                  affording food for Thanksgiving. She knew the food bank would be there for her.</p>
               <p>“This is going to help a lot,” she said as volunteers loaded bags of holiday food – including ham and
                  sides – into her trunk. “We’ll have this for the holiday, and then have leftovers for a while too.”
                  The food helps Roberta make the day special for her family, but she’s focused on more than that.</p>
               <p>“It would be a normal day without this food,” she said. “I’m grateful for the food and I’m just really
                  thankful for all the blessings we have.”</p>

               <p><strong>Wai'anae , Hawaii</strong></p>
               <p> As the COVID pandemic reached Hawaii in spring 2020, local farmers were hit hard. With many on very
                  slim margins, the pandemic made operating small family farms incredibly challenging to sustain.</p>

               <p>“As business slowed down, we asked ourselves, ‘How are we going to deal with it? Do we still keep
                  planting?’ It all happened so suddenly, but we knew people still needed food,” said Tony Wong Cam of
                  Huang’s Green Leaf Products – a farm in Wai’anae, Hawaii.</p>

               <p>But the farm persevered – thanks to a partnership with the Hawaii Foodbank.</p>

               <p>The Hawaii Foodbank is a food bank that provides food to families in need.“Thanks to Hawaii Foodbank,
                  we kept planting, and we were able to keep our 35 employees working,” said company matriarch Fanny
                  Gan, Tony’s mother. “For me, I really rely on the food bank, and I believe other farmers are, too.”
               </p>

               <p>In 2019, the food bank purchased 21,000 pounds of pak choy and kai choy from Huang’s Green Leaf
                  Products.The food bank committed to purchasing $750,000 in local agricultural products for its food
                  programs – including more than 21,000 pounds of pak choy and kai choy from Huang’s Green Leaf
                  Products. And in doing so, the food bank helped preserve the family’s farming legacy, which began on a
                  two-acre lot in Wai’anae more than 20 years ago.</p>

               <p>“I just needed something to do with the skills my husband had. He’s the one who chose farming,” Fanny
                  Gan says of their humble start. “After working all those years, I’ve learned little by little, and now
                  I enjoy it because I know we’re providing food for a lot of people.”</p>

               <p>“When they began, my parents saw a need to provide for me and my siblings. Now, they are providing
                  food and sustenance for many people,” says Tony.</p>

               <p>While Tony believes creativity and staying relevant are important, he also knows believing in what you
                  do is what truly brings success. “When COVID-19 hit, our operation of planting remained normal because
                  we believed. We never stopped believing. And when Hawaii Foodbank wanted product, we were ready,” says
                  Tony. “The program really supports local farmers, and the extra demand for locally desired vegetables
                  is something we really appreciate. It has not been easy but hearing how people are receiving our
                  products makes my mom and dad very happy. They feel like they are giving back.”</p>

               <p>So far, the Hawaii Foodbank has partnered with 19 local farms, ensuring key sources of agriculture
                  remain sustainable, and fresh, local produce is available to communities facing hunger.</p>

               <p>While Tony believes creativity and staying relevant are important, he also knows believing in what you
                  do is what truly brings success. “When COVID-19 hit, our operation of planting remained normal because
                  we believed. We never stopped believing. And when Hawaii Foodbank wanted product, we were ready,” says
                  Tony. “The program really supports local farmers, and the extra demand for locally desired vegetables
                  is something we really appreciate. It has not been easy but hearing how people are receiving our
                  products makes my mom and dad very happy. They feel like they are giving back.”</p>

               <p>So far, the Hawaii Foodbank has partnered with 19 local farms, ensuring key sources of agriculture
                  remain sustainable, and fresh, local produce is available to communities facing hunger.</p>

               <p>67-year-old Alma really likes to give and receive hugs. In fact, it might be her favorite thing to do.
                  And that’s because she’s always looking on the bright side of life.</p>

               <p>“I have a positive attitude always,” she said. “Life is too short. You’ve got to live life to the
                  fullest.”</p>

               <p>That attitude gives Alma strength, even in the face of a challenging time in her life. She’s taking
                  care of her daughter, who faces a disability. And, she manages to work four days a week to help make
                  ends meet.</p>

               <p>“I’ve been a workaholic all my life,” she admits proudly. “Always trying to get more hours, do more.”
               </p>

               <p>When Thanksgiving arrived this year, Alma didn’t hesitate to reach out for a little extra help. She
                  visited the Northeast Iowa Food Bank’s holiday food distribution in Waterloo to get ham and other
                  traditional holiday food</p>

               <p>“This is a blessing,” she said. “We’d make it; we’d scrape by without this. I’d be sure of it. But
                  this does help.”</p>

            <div class="medial">
               <img class="imagel " src="/lovekesh work/image4.png" alt="Global Hunger Index">
               <p class="textl">The 2023 Global Hunger Index shows that since 2015 little progress has been made in
                  reducing hunger. The 2023 GHI score for the world is 18.3, considered moderate. This is less than one
                  point below the world’s 2015 GHI score of 19.1, indicating that progress on reducing hunger has
                  largely stalled. In contrast, between 2000, 2008, and 2015, the world made significant headway against
                  hunger. There has been an increase in the prevalence of undernourishment, one of the indicators used
                  in the calculation of GHI scores, rising from a low of 7.5 percent in 2017 to 9.2 percent in 2022. The
                  number of undernourished people in the world increased from 572 million to 735 million in this period.
                  The 2023 GHI scores are based on data from 2018–2022, including the latest data available in this
                  period for each of the four GHI indicators. Because the vast majority of these data are from 2020 or
                  later, they can more fully capture the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic than the data in previous GHI
                  reports.The increase in the number of undernourished people from 572 million to 735 million during
                  this period further illustrates the deteriorating situation. The 2023 GHI scores, derived from data
                  spanning 2018 to 2022, incorporate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated food
                  insecurity worldwide. This stagnation calls for renewed efforts and strategies to combat hunger and
                  achieve sustainable food security.</p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="boxl">
            <div class="medial">
               <img class="imagel" src="/lovekesh work/image5.png" alt="Hunger Levels by Country">
               <p class="textl">According to the 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores and provisional designations,
                  nine countries are experiencing alarming levels of hunger, while 34 countries are grappling with
                  serious levels of hunger. Among these, six countries have GHI scores that fall within the alarming
                  range. These countries are the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of
                  the Congo, Lesotho, and Niger.The alarming levels of hunger in these countries highlight the severe
                  challenges they face in ensuring food security for their populations. Factors contributing to these
                  high levels of hunger include political instability, conflict, economic downturns, and climatic
                  shocks, which disrupt food production and access. The situation in these regions underscores the
                  urgent need for targeted interventions and international support to address the root causes of hunger
                  and malnutrition. Sustainable solutions such as improving agricultural productivity, enhancing food
                  distribution systems, and providing emergency food assistance are crucial to alleviating hunger in
                  these critically affected areas. The GHI scores serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing global
                  struggle against hunger and the imperative to intensify efforts towards achieving zero hunger by 2030.

         <div class="boxl">
            <div class="medial">

               <p class="textl">Conclusion: The crises the world has faced in recent years have undermined progress
                  toward ending hunger, and the future portends a continuing onslaught of crises for which the world is
                  not prepared. Underpinning this unfortunate expectation is the acceleration of climate change, which
                  is likely to generate not only direct, weather-related crises such as droughts, flooding, extreme
                  storms, and heat but also indirect crises such as pandemics, conflict, and displacement—all of which
                  can contribute to hunger without adept responses. Given the vast inequality in today’s world, these
                  burdens will be disproportionately shouldered by those who already suffer the most from hunger,
                  poverty, conflict, and poor governance.</p>

            <pf class="textf">Food donations play a crucial role in alleviating hunger and supporting vulnerable
               communities. Each year, millions of people face food insecurity, unsure of where their next meal will
               come from. Through the generosity of donors, food banks and charitable organizations can provide
               nutritious meals to those in need. The act of donating food not only helps meet immediate needs but also
               fosters a sense of community and compassion, bridging the gap between those who have surplus and those
               who lack.</pf>

         <div class="boxf">
            <img class="image1f" src="/lovekesh work/image11.png" alt="pie chart">
            <pf class="textf" id="text1">A significant portion of donated food comes from individuals, local businesses,
               and farmers. In fact, a pie chart representing the sources of food donations reveals that donations of
               dairy products as well as grains make up 25%, while fresh produce contribute 33.3% and rest contribution
               is done by meat that is 25%. This diverse sourcing ensures a variety of foods are available, from fresh
               produce to non-perishable items, catering to different dietary needs and preferences. By working
               together, these contributors create a robust supply chain that supports food banks and shelters across
               the country.</pf>

            <pf class="textf">Food donations not only provide immediate relief but also contribute to long-term
               sustainability. By preventing food waste, donors help reduce the environmental impact associated with
               excess food production. Another graph shows the breakdown of how food donations are utilized: 50% goes
               directly to feeding programs, 30% is stored for emergency reserves, and 20% supports educational and
               community initiatives. These initiatives include nutrition education and cooking classes, empowering
               individuals and families to make healthier food choices and reduce their reliance on emergency food aid.
