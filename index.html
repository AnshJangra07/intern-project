            <p>I am not poor! Why should I help in eliminating poverty? Well, we are all humans and are dependent on
               each other for our needs. Initially, if you see a poor farmer you might get a notion that you are not
               dependent on him because he seems poor and struggling to have a good living. But wait, where does food on
               your plate come from? You got your answer, right! Likewise, we are dependent on daily wage laborers,
               rickshaw pullers, etc. and so are they on us. So eliminating poverty will make the life of the poor ones
               better which will indirectly reflect in our lives too.</p>

               <p><strong>Wai'anae , Hawaii</strong></p>
               <p> As the COVID pandemic reached Hawaii in spring 2020, local farmers were hit hard. With many on very
                  slim margins, the pandemic made operating small family farms incredibly challenging to sustain.</p>

               <p>“As business slowed down, we asked ourselves, ‘How are we going to deal with it? Do we still keep
                  planting?’ It all happened so suddenly, but we knew people still needed food,” said Tony Wong Cam of
                  Huang’s Green Leaf Products – a farm in Wai’anae, Hawaii.</p>

               <p>But the farm persevered – thanks to a partnership with the Hawaii Foodbank.</p>

               <p>The Hawaii Foodbank is a food bank that provides food to families in need.“Thanks to Hawaii Foodbank,
                  we kept planting, and we were able to keep our 35 employees working,” said company matriarch Fanny
                  Gan, Tony’s mother. “For me, I really rely on the food bank, and I believe other farmers are, too.”
               </p>

               <p>In 2019, the food bank purchased 21,000 pounds of pak choy and kai choy from Huang’s Green Leaf
                  Products.The food bank committed to purchasing $750,000 in local agricultural products for its food
                  programs – including more than 21,000 pounds of pak choy and kai choy from Huang’s Green Leaf
                  Products. And in doing so, the food bank helped preserve the family’s farming legacy, which began on a
                  two-acre lot in Wai’anae more than 20 years ago.</p>

               <p>“I just needed something to do with the skills my husband had. He’s the one who chose farming,” Fanny
                  Gan says of their humble start. “After working all those years, I’ve learned little by little, and now
                  I enjoy it because I know we’re providing food for a lot of people.”</p>

               <p>“When they began, my parents saw a need to provide for me and my siblings. Now, they are providing
                  food and sustenance for many people,” says Tony.</p>

               <p>While Tony believes creativity and staying relevant are important, he also knows believing in what you
                  do is what truly brings success. “When COVID-19 hit, our operation of planting remained normal because
                  we believed. We never stopped believing. And when Hawaii Foodbank wanted product, we were ready,” says
                  Tony. “The program really supports local farmers, and the extra demand for locally desired vegetables
                  is something we really appreciate. It has not been easy but hearing how people are receiving our
                  products makes my mom and dad very happy. They feel like they are giving back.”</p>

               <p>So far, the Hawaii Foodbank has partnered with 19 local farms, ensuring key sources of agriculture
                  remain sustainable, and fresh, local produce is available to communities facing hunger.</p>
